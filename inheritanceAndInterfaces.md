## Homework

Practice what you have learned about using classes, abstract classes and interfaces to model and test a simple system from one of the following options:

## Theme Park

Model a theme park and its customers.

1. Using a 'Ride' abstract class, create 2 or 3 types of rides (FOR EXAMPLE: rollercoasters, dodgems, waltzers, ghost trains). Parameters could include price, min age/height etc.
2. Using a customer abstract class create instances of people to use the rides. Give them an age, height and money.
3. Allow the customers to interact with the rides (I.E. check they are tall/old enough) have them pay their money.

# Extension:

4. Expand the model in whichever direction you like. Add different types of ride, create a queuing system.


## Kaiju Attack.

Model a Kaiju (Large Japanese Monster) Attack On A City.

1. Using a 'Kaiju' abstract class, create two giant lizards to run amok in Tokyo. Parameters for each Kaiju should include; 'name', 'healthValue' and 'attackValue'.Give the Kaiju a 'roar' method which returns a string.
2. Using a 'Vehicle' abstract class, create two Army vehicles to battle the Kaiju. Parameters should include; 'type' and 'healthValue'.
3. Give the Kaiju an 'attack' method which can be used to damage vehicles.
4. Give the Kaiju a 'move'/'fly' method, which returns a string (depending on the Kaiju).
5. Give the army vehicles two methods of damaging the Kaiju. (Give the vehicles attack methods).

# Extension:

6. Expand the model to include buildings, more Kaiju and anything else you can think of.

## OR YOU COULD ALWAYS:

Pick a system/scenario that interests or seems relevant to you - which you can visualise easily - then attempt to model that system in Java.
This can be anything you want!
